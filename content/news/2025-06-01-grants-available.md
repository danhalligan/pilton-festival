The Pilton Green Man Community Interest Organisation (CIO) is pleased to announce that applications are now open for our 2025 community grants program. We have £15,000 available to support local projects that will benefit the Pilton community and surrounding areas.

## About Our Grants Program

Since establishing the CIO in 2019, we have distributed over £45,000 to local projects, ranging from playground equipment and community gardens to support for local sports clubs and educational initiatives. Our grants are funded entirely through the proceeds of Green Man Day and other community fundraising activities.
