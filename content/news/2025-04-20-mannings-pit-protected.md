After years of campaigning and fundraising, we are thrilled to announce that Manning's Pit – 18 acres of beautiful woodland and meadow land on the edge of Pilton – has been permanently protected from development and secured for community use.

This incredible achievement represents one of the most significant conservation successes in our area's recent history, and it wouldn't have been possible without the dedication of local volunteers and the generous support of the wider community.

## The Campaign Journey

The campaign to save Manning's Pit began in 2022 when planning applications were submitted for residential development on this precious green space. What followed was an extraordinary display of community solidarity and determination.
