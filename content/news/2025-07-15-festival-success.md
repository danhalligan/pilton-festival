Despite the challenging weather conditions, the 2025 Green Man Day festival was a resounding success, bringing together hundreds of community members for a day of celebration, music, and traditional festivities.

The morning started with heavy showers, but that didn't dampen the spirits of our dedicated volunteers who had spent weeks preparing for the event. By noon, the rain had eased, and families began arriving with umbrellas and raincoats, ready to enjoy everything the festival had to offer.

## Highlights of the Day

The traditional Green Man procession was particularly moving this year, with the newly crafted Green Man figure leading a parade of children and adults through the village. The craftsmanship of this year's Green Man, created by local artist Sarah Mitchell, was exceptional and drew admiration from visitors and locals alike.

Local musicians provided entertainment throughout the day, with the Pilton Folk Band delivering an especially memorable performance under the main gazebo. Despite the weather, their energy was infectious, and soon we had a crowd of children dancing in the rain.

## Community Spirit Shines Through

What struck us most about this year's festival was the incredible community spirit on display. When the weather threatened to disrupt outdoor activities, volunteers quickly reorganized events, and local business owners opened their doors to provide additional shelter.

The tea tent, run by the Women's Institute, served over 300 cups of tea and hot chocolate throughout the day. The local cricket club provided their pavilion as additional shelter, and several local families invited visitors into their gardens when the heaviest showers hit.

## Looking Forward

Despite the weather challenges, we raised over £4,500 for local community projects – a testament to the generosity of everyone who attended. These funds will go directly back into the community through our grant program, supporting local initiatives and next year's festival.

Planning for Green Man Day 2026 begins in September, and we're already excited about what we can achieve together. Thank you to everyone who made this year's festival such a special day, rain and all!
