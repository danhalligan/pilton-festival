# Green Man Day 2024: Community Spirit in the Rain

The 2024 Green Man Day proved that not even the heaviest July rain could dampen the spirits of the Pilton community. Despite what turned out to be the wettest day of the month, hundreds of residents and visitors came together for a celebration that perfectly embodied the resilience and camaraderie that defines our festival.

## A Day of Determination

From the early morning setup, it was clear that this year's festival would be different. The rain started before dawn and continued throughout the day, but our dedicated volunteers pressed on, erecting gazebos, setting up stalls, and preparing for what would become one of our most memorable celebrations.

## The Procession Proceeds

Despite the challenging conditions, the traditional Green Man procession went ahead as planned. The sight of the Green Man figure leading a determined parade of children and adults through the wet streets of Pilton was both moving and inspiring. The procession's arrival at Pilton House was greeted with cheers from the gathered crowd, safely sheltered under the large gazebos.

## Community Adaptation

What struck everyone most about this year's festival was how quickly the community adapted to the conditions. Local business owners opened their doors to provide additional shelter, the Women's Institute served hot tea and soup to warm chilled festival-goers, and families shared umbrellas with strangers.

### Creative Solutions

- **Extra gazebos** were quickly erected by volunteers
- **Local shops** opened their doors for shelter
- **Hot food stalls** became gathering points for warmth
- **Indoor activities** were improvised in the church hall

## A Successful Sunday

Recognizing that the weather had limited outdoor activities, organizers made the brilliant decision to hold the annual Pilton Treasure Hunt on Sunday, July 21st. With clearer skies and dry paths, families enjoyed exploring the village in much more pleasant conditions.

*The Sunday Treasure Hunt took place in much better weather conditions, with families exploring the village and discovering "The Priors Ring 1867" as the answer*

## Financial Impact and Community Support

Despite the weather challenges, the festival managed to raise significant funds for community projects, though there was an unavoidable loss of approximately Â£1,500 due to reduced sales in the Green Man Inn and Pimms Tent. The community's continued support, even in difficult conditions, was truly heartwarming.

## Looking Forward

The 2024 festival reminded us all that Green Man Day is about much more than perfect weather - it's about community, tradition, and the bonds that hold us together. The sight of neighbors helping neighbors, volunteers working tirelessly despite the rain, and families determined to enjoy their annual celebration will long be remembered as the true spirit of Pilton.

## Thank You

A massive thank you goes to:
- **All volunteers** who worked tirelessly in challenging conditions
- **Stallholders** who braved the weather to participate
- **Local businesses** who provided shelter and support
- **Every family and individual** who attended despite the rain
- **Emergency services** who ensured everyone's safety
