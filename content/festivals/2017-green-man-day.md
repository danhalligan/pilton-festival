# Green Man Day 2017: Creativity and Community Spirit

Despite the challenging weather conditions, Green Man Day 2017 showcased the incredible creativity and determination of the Pilton community. From innovative decorations to new performance spaces, this year's festival demonstrated that great community spirit can shine through even the gloomiest of summer days.

## A Creative Vision

The 2017 festival was distinguished by extraordinary creative touches that transformed the village. Most notably, Liz Eveleigh's brilliant new bunting adorned Pilton Street, adding vibrant colors that brightened even the greyest moments of the day.

## The Wellies Project

In the weeks leading up to the festival, a delightful community art project emerged: decorated wellies began appearing throughout the village. Over thirty pairs of creatively decorated wellington boots could be found in gardens, on windowsills, and hanging from trees, creating a trail of whimsical art that delighted visitors and locals alike.

### Wellie Creativity

The decorated wellies showed incredible imagination:
- **Flower-filled boots** turned into garden planters
- **Painted designs** featuring local landmarks
- **Character wellies** representing local personalities
- **Seasonal themes** celebrating summer and harvest

## New Pageant Arena

One of the most significant innovations of 2017 was the creation of a new pageant arena at the top of Rotary Gardens. This woodland setting provided a magical backdrop for the traditional Green Man pageant, creating an even more atmospheric experience for the audience.

## Friday Night Entertainment

The festival weekend kicked off with something completely different: a murder mystery evening in the Church Hall. "Who Killed the Pop Star?" challenged fifteen teams to solve the mystery of which member of the boy band "Wha-Hey!!" had been murdered. The event was a roaring success and added a new dimension to the festival weekend.

## Weather Resilience

While the light drizzle and occasional heavier showers meant that some outdoor activities were curtailed, the community's response was truly inspiring. The new bunting provided not just decoration but also some shelter, and the covered areas became gathering points for socializing and entertainment.

### Community Adaptation

- **Indoor activities** moved to the Church Hall
- **Covered stalls** became social hubs
- **Hot food and drinks** were especially popular
- **Community spirit** shone through adversity

## The Pageant Tradition

Despite the weather, the Green Man pageant went ahead twice as usual in its stunning new woodland setting. The rain actually added to the mystical atmosphere as the Green Man emerged from the trees, and the audience's enthusiasm was undimmed by the conditions.

## Sunday Salvation

After Saturday's challenging weather, Sunday offered redemption with dry conditions and even some sunshine. The family treasure hunt around the village center was particularly well-attended, with participants enjoying exploring Pilton in much more pleasant conditions. The event concluded with tea and cake in the Church Hall.

*Over thirty decorated wellies appeared throughout the village in the weeks before the festival, showing incredible community creativity and adding whimsical art to every corner of Pilton*

## Volunteer Heroes

The 2017 festival highlighted the incredible dedication of our volunteer team. Setting up and running a festival in challenging weather conditions requires extra effort and patience, and our volunteers rose to the occasion magnificently.

### Behind the Scenes

- **Early morning setup** in drizzle
- **Constant weather monitoring** and adjustments
- **Additional shelter** erected throughout the day
- **Extended cleanup** to ensure everything was properly dried and stored

## Creative Legacy

The innovations of 2017 - particularly Liz Eveleigh's bunting and the decorated wellies project - created a lasting legacy. The bunting continued to be used in subsequent years, and the community art projects inspired similar initiatives in later festivals.

## Serenity Returns

By Monday morning, serenity had returned completely to Pilton Street, and by Tuesday even the bunting had been carefully taken down and stored for future use. The rapid transformation back to everyday village life never fails to amaze, but the memories and community bonds created during the festival weekend remain.

## Financial Success

Despite the weather challenges, the 2017 festival still managed to raise significant funds for community causes, demonstrating the loyalty and generosity of our supporters who attended regardless of conditions.

## Thank You

Special recognition goes to:
- **Liz Eveleigh** for the magnificent new bunting
- **All wellie decorators** who added whimsy to our streets
- **Weather-brave volunteers** who worked tirelessly
- **Dedicated stallholders** who persevered despite conditions
- **Loyal attendees** who celebrated with us come rain or shine

*Green Man Day 2017 proved that community spirit, creativity, and determination can triumph over any weather. It was a festival that will be remembered not for what the weather took away, but for what the community created in response.*
