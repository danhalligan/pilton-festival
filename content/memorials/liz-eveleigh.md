I first met Liz almost 25 years ago in the back of Albert's shop where we were making costumes for Pilton Festival, and we remained friends ever since. Liz was a skilled seamstress, and over the years she made 100's of costumes for the Festival and pantomime! Liz was a key contributor to the Pilton community spirit and was known and loved by everyone. She was on the Festival Committee for many years, helping to organise the Festival, and also a Church Hall Committee member, and during that time was heavily involved in the refurbishment of the Church Hall.

Liz was always there to support and help with the running of community social events. Both Liz and Jim, her devoted late husband, were great fun to be with, and we have lots of happy memories from those times. Above all Liz was a good, kind, gentle, caring, wonderful person, and a special friend to many people, we will miss her terribly.
