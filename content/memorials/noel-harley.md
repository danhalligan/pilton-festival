In April 2009, we lost a dear friend in Dr Noel Harley. Along with his wife Pet, Noel was a stalwart of community life here in Pilton and was a founder member of the re-incarnation of Pilton Festival. Noel was the inspiration behind many of us who are involved in a broad spectrum of activities today, all of us fueled by his enormous sense of fun and touched by his generosity of spirit. Speaking of spirit, if you keep your eyes peeled, you might just spot Noel's uproarious Festival tights, dancing in the breeze from a favoured tree!
