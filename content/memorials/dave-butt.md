Pilton lost a gifted community leader with the passing of Dave Butt in April 2016. Dave was Assistant Headteacher at Braunton Academy until 2010, a Barnstaple Town and then North Devon District Councillor and Honorary Alderman and a leading player in the Pilton community. He contributed enormously to the world of rugby, was Chairman of Devon RFU, and was closely involved in the 2015 World Cup. He was a huge supporter of the Barnstaple-based charity Amigos Worldwide, and worked as a volunteer for Children's Hospice South West. Although he had stepped down from formal public duty in recent years, Dave was still very much involved in North Devon Theatres and Museum. Pilton will be a poorer place for his loss. Among his legacies is a stronger Green Man Festival where his ability to bring people together and get things to happen resulted in the growing involvement of the next generation willing to help the community come together. His will be difficult shoes to fill but he surely did much to inspire people to pick up where sadly he has left off.
