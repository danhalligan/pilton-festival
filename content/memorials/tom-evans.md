The Pilton Green Man Procession lost its figurehead in June 2019 with the death of Barnstaple Town Crier, historian and legend Tom Evans at the age of only 66. Tom was one of Barnstaple's most recognisable characters in his role as a guide and tourist information officer. In Pilton he was best known for leading the popular, annual Green Man procession from Barnstaple Museum to Pilton which he had done for upwards of 20 years. His proclamation of the appearance of the Green Man and the start of the market was an important part of the magic of the day. He will be much missed and is a difficult act to follow.
