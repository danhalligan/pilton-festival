Pilton has just lost one of the world's most beautiful souls. Anne Featherstone was truly a child of the universe. The amount of good that she brought to the world, the number of broken bodies she fixed, and the countless minds she put at ease are astonishing. She had the remarkable gift of having all the time in the world for everyone equally. She gave that time to encourage, to inspire and to heal. No one could leave an encounter with her without feeling more wholesome as a result of it. Holistic by nature, she could effortlessly get to the root of people's problems. With each patient, it was less about the physiotherapy and more about helping to heal the emotional and psychological wounds that can come with long term injuries. She wove her love of nature into her every day, and could often be found by an open window at 4am in summer, cup of tea in hand, listening to the dawn chorus.

She was not only a strong woman, but also a woman whose mind was at peace with the world. This strong, calm, beautiful mind was a place of refuge for many hundreds, if not thousands, of people over the years. Her love of food and love of feeding people were also another wholesome string to her bow. The world is just not the same without her, but to all those whose lives she touched, you should carry on her legacy of goodness.
