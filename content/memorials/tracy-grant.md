I asked people to sum Tracy up in one word. "Lovely", "Kind", "Brave", "Genuine", "Talented", "Fun" and "Beautiful" were just some of the all positive words used. She was one of those people that made life brighter to be in her company, a kind and considerate person who always looked out for others. In the 20 years that I knew her, I never once heard her say anything unkind about anyone. She always looked for the good and positive in people. Tracy lived with her husband Rick and the other love of her life, their Jack Russell, Mitch. On several occasions Tracy said that the two best things she had done in life were to meet and marry Rick and to get Mitch. She met Rick when he was a DJ in Bees Night club and she started heckling him to play better music! Tracy was a hard-worker and thrived on being busy. She worked for several years at Saunton Golf Club and was so loved by them that, when she became poorly, they organised a rota to drive her to Exeter for treatment. Tracy was always willing to be involved in anything community-orientated and in the last couple of years took on the temporary Hall bar, and through it raised much needed money. She liked to be busy and even when she had to leave work she started making greetings cards, Christmas cakes and chocolates to sell at craft markets – all profits went to charity. Tracy was diagnosed with cancer several years ago. She bore the news bravely and stayed positive and still looked out for others. Tracy was all of the adjectives people gave me to describe her, and more. Tracy – still loved and always missed.
